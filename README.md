# CloneXTTSv2

This only works with WSL2 (I assume linux as well). Windows is not supported and I suggest not even attempting. If you ignore this and get stuck trying to use windows, you're on your own. I wont help you, as it is a massive waste of time.
-- Were working with the XTTSv2 Coquii Recipe. Its in the TTS repo youre about to clone under recipes ljspeech etc...

--Download/install Miniconda--

--CREATE AND ACTIVATE ENV--
```
conda create --name xtts python==3.10
conda activate xtts
```

--INSTALL TORCH--
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (Dont use "conda install" use "pip3 install". Conda with these repos and libraries just doesnt work, I didnt look into it. Use this whl as well)
```

--INSTALL FMMPEG/RUST--
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
pip install setuptools-rust
```

```
sudo apt-get install g++
```

--INSTALL COQUII TTS--
```
git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
cd TTS
pip install -e .[all,dev,notebooks]
make system-deps                     (Do all three, doesnt work without it, dont know why, ask coquii)
make install

We need to edit Trainer.py Lines 759 - 763 (Or at least I did with my datasets)

   @staticmethod
    def setup_training_environment(args, config, gpu):
        if platform.system() != "Windows":
            pass                                                                               # pass

- get data set, 1 48khz wav file, MONO. 

- Get reference audio (length and amount unknown. Experiment)

- Use segmenter.py, first create a folder named "training" in the "training folder make another folder named "wavs". Put all segments into the "wavs" folder. Point script at your 48khz single .wav file and "wavs" folder..

- Use transcriber.py, pointing it at the "wavs" folder. METADATA.CSV must go into your "training" folder.
   - The format of metadata.csv follows ljspeech: "audio1|transcription|validation" or if you have no validation, repeat transcription: "audio1|transcription|transcription"
   - The script will transcribe good audio and remove any audio it doesnt understand putting it in the badAudio folder.
   - It will create metadata.csv for you. Lining up your segments with the corresponding transcript.
   - You have the option to validate the text. I have no script for that. 

- Convert all of your new segmented audio clips into 22050 khz audio files for training. (I have since edited the segmenter script. I'm under the impression the sample rate will no longer matter. If you want to use something besides 22050 for this you should be able to. I have yet to test this though.)
   The segmenter script i made doesn't accept 22050 khz audio files. The train_gpt_xtts.py script we will use makes use of the DVAE model/Data which is a 22050 sample rate. It appears that you may be able to get away with keeping your own dataset at 48000khz. I have tried this and ended up with a chipmunk sounding 
   output. There couldve been an error somewhere else but from what I could see it was this upscaling from 22050 that caused it.

- Go through train_gpt_xtts.py and fill out the file paths pointing to your dataset, metadata.csv, and reference audio.

- Change any parameters according to hardware. Pay attention to learning rate, its set to a very slow rate by default.

- in the train_gpt_xtts.py/GPTTrainerConfig script the "eval_split_size" was missing. It defaults to .01 which wouldn't be enough for smaller datasets. Adjust other parameters as needed.
   config = GPTTrainerConfig(
           output_path=OUT_PATH,
           model_args=model_args,
           run_name=RUN_NAME,
           project_name=PROJECT_NAME,
           run_description="""
               GPT XTTS training
               """,
           dashboard_logger=DASHBOARD_LOGGER,
           logger_uri=LOGGER_URI,
           audio=audio_config,
           batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
           batch_group_size=22,
           eval_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
           num_loader_workers=8,
           eval_split_max_size=256,
           eval_split_size=0.11,      # !!!This line right here!!!. When you clone the repo it is missing, add it. For my 151 audio files, using .11 got me to 16 eval samples. Normal range of eval samples is between 15-30.
           print_step=50,
           plot_step=100,
           log_model_step=100,
           save_step=150,
           save_n_checkpoints=1,
           save_checkpoints=True,

- This is a very finnicky process with a lot of points of possible failure. Expect some trial and error. I tried to remove as much possibilty for human error as possible with transcriber.py and segmenter.py. I would still advise you to manually check at least some of the output. 

- Again, and I cannot reiterate this enough. Dataset is everything, if your model comes out sounding like crap its because your dataset is crap. That would be where I go to first.

Run python3 train_gpt_xtts.py
